<h1>HR label cheat sheet</h1>
	
	
<p style="color:red; font-size: 150%;">This document is only a temporary storage place for information we expect to integrate elsewhere. Do not rely on it for information. It will be radically changed, and may be deleted entirely.</p> 
<p>This document provides hints for use of HR tracker labels, targeted at 3 different roles. Find the section that reflects your role. You can ignore the other sections.</p>
<h2>Audience: A Working Group developing a spec</h2>
<table>
<tr>
<th>A <span class="label needs-resolution">*-needs-resolution</span> label has been added to an issue in the WG repo.</th>
<td>
<p>Work with  the horizontal review group to resolve their request, if possible. </p>
<p>Do not remove this label, and do not add such labels yourself.  Do not remove when closing the issue, either. Only the Horizontal Review (HR) group should manage these labels.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>An issue is created that may have relevance to a Horizontal Review group.</th>
<td><ol>
<li>Add a <span class="label needs-resolution">*-tracker</span> label to the issue. Tooling will alert the HR group to the existence of this issue via their notification system. Don't remove the label once you assigned it (unless it was an error). </li>
<li>If you want some specific advice from the HR group, describe that request in the thread.</li>
</ol>
<p>The HR group may convert this to a <span class="label needs-resolution">*-needs-resolution</span> label, if they want to see a specific resolution. If so, they should indicate the desired resolution in the thread and handle the necessary label changes.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>The WG wants to close an issue with HR labels.</th>
<td><ol>
<li>If the issue has a <span class="label needs-resolution">*-needs-resolution</span> label, check with the HR group whether they are satisfied with the proposed resolution.</li>
<li>Close the issue without removing the HR labels.</li>
</ol></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>The WG comes to the end of a wide review.</th>
<td><ol>
<li>Check that all issues (open and closed) that have a <span class="label needs-resolution">*-needs-resolution</span> label have been resolved to the satisfaction of the HR group.</li>
<li>Indicate to the HR group that you believe all such issues are resolved, so that they can check and hopefully close their tracker issues.</li>
</ol>
<p>You don't have to do the above for issues with the <span class="label needs-resolution">*-tracker</span> label. (The HR group was only tracking those issues, not expecting a particular resolution.)</p></td>

<li>The HR group looks at the issue and decides whether it should continue with the <span class="label needs-resolution">tracker</span> label.</li>
<li><em>If the HR group wants to see a particular resolution to the issue:</em> they indicate that desired resolution in the WG repo, and change the labels in both repos to <span class="label needs-resolution">*-needs-resolution</span>.</li>
<li>The HR group removes the <span class="label pending">pending</span> label from the issue in the HR repo.</li>
</ol></td>

<tr>
<th>A reviewer comes across an issue during a review and wants to raise it.</th>
<td><ol>
<li>Create a new issue in the HR tracker repo, describing the issue. (There should be some boilerplate instructions.)</li>
<li>Apply a <span class="label pending">pending</span> label.</li>
<li>Apply a <span class="label spec">s:xxx</span> label with the short name for the spec.</li>

<tr>
<th>The tooling created a tracker issue in the HR repo but there was no <span class="label spec">s:xxx</span> label. This means that the issues don't show up in the 'board'.</th>
<td><p>This sometimes happens because the tool fails to find the shortname for a repo like CSS that has many shortnames. It may also happen if the thing being tracked doesn't have a shortname, such as webex implementations, or CG documents that don't yet have shortnames.</p>
<ol>
<li>The new issue will come into the HR repo with a <span class="label pending">pending</span> label, indicating that you need to check is has the appropriate additional labels. While doing that, simply invent a <span class="label spec">s:xxx</span> label in GitHub and assign it to the relevant issue(s) (eg. <span class="label spec">s:webex</span>). The label doesn't have to represent an actual shortname for the board to pick it up. The board will automatically display issues with that label in a new section.</li>
<li>At some point in the future you may need to change the <span class="label spec">s:xxx</span> label (eg. if a document does finally get a shortname, and it's different to what you were using). That's no problem. Just rename the existing label using the GH interface, and the board will continue to create a section with that name and group all the relevant issues therein.</li>
